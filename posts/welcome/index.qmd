# What you can expect
I intend this blog to be mostly a technical blog on my journey through the rest of my career. You can expect to see articles about topics in Machine Learning, .NET, C#, python and other technical topics.  

I’m not limiting the posts strictly technical topics. I have many other roles in my life besides being a software engineer and consultant. I’m a father of three, I’m a husband, I run, I build things, I fix things, I break things, I like cars the list goes on. You might see these things sprinkled in.
