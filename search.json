    "text": "dad, husband, runner, handyman and engineer.\nI’ve been a software engineer for over 12 years. My career started in semiconductor manufacturing where I developed and maintained manufacturing automation systems. It was challenging and fun. Eventually I found my way into software consulting.\nI’ve worked on several .NET projects in a variety of industries and varying solution type. Some projects highlights include building and improving web applications, developing identity solutions, event-based systems, modernizing systems, and data engineering.\nAway from my keyboard, you’ll usually find me running, hanging out with my family, fixing things around the house, and building things."
