    "section": "",
    "text": "“All we have to decide is what to do with the time given to us.”\n–  J.R.R. Tolkien, Fellowship of the Ring.\nLast month I wrote about making improvements to my running performance. I had to make the time for more strength training required to boost my speed, and strength overall. Fortunately, I had some established tools and habits I could lean on to help me, but before we get into them, what does defending your time mean?\nDefending your time consists of three things:\nStep 1  The easiest of the three. What do you want to do? What are your goals, hobbies, projects, and things you need to take care of? People you want to see? Write them down and prioritize them by importance.\nStep 2  Where can you fit these into your schedule? Is there anything you’re doing that is taking time away from the things you want to do? This is where I’d start to examine things that aren’t providing value. Scrolling on social media is an easy example from my own experience. A few years ago I realized that I had a habit of going to Facebook when opening a browser. It was bad - I mean I wasn’t even thinking about it. I had no intention of being on Facebook yet I would ask myself after scrolling for a minute or two or ten “How the hell did I get here? What did I mean to do or look up?”. Deactivating my account was the first step and found that this simple step broke my habit and made time for more meaningful things in my life. Last year I deleted my data and account altogether.\nMaking time and Finding time do not mean the same thing. Making time puts you in control of your intentions and how to use your time. Finding time for things gives away your control and forces you to fit stuff in. The day or week isn’t going to go perfectly, things are going to happen that are out of your control and you’ll find that time will fly by and your endeavor will go with it. Making the time is a simple reframing that gives you agency and permission to say no to things that don’t matter.\nStep 3  Stick to the plan. This is the hard part. This is where “defending” comes in. A few examples:\nWho’s in charge in these situations? The simple answer is YOU."

    "text": "Tools\nDefending your time is hard and doesn’t get easier the more responsibilities you take on, but there are simple tools and habits that can help you.\nThe main two tools I use are simple: My calendar and my journal.\n\nCalendar\nMy digital calendar is by far the most used and easiest to use to make time. It keeps me accountable and sets others’ expectations of my availability. I described my main blocks down below.\n\n\nJournal\nThis is relatively new. I’ve tried journaling on and off for years but last year I committed to Bullet Journaling and found it worked well for me. It gave me enough structure but also flexibility to make it my own.\nBesides day-to-day tasks and reminders, I use it for quotes, notes, random thoughts, and doodles. It’s nice to go back and look at them too. I went back and found my son’s diaper and feeding log when he was first born.\nHandwriting is therapeutic too. When life gets busy it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Writing my thoughts, notes and reminders gets it out of my head, and relieves some stress. I also love the satisfaction of checking off tasks from my to-do list."

    "section": "My Everyday Time Blocks",
    "text": "My Everyday Time Blocks\nScheduling the time in the calendar is one thing but having a purpose for each block is another. I’ve made a habit of scheduling key parts of my day. These are my most used and recurring. Occasionally they’ll need to shift around but the important thing is the time block moves, but is NOT deleted.\n\nFocus Time\nThis is recurring every day and happens first. I get a cup of coffee and head to my office. Cracking open my journal, I reflect on the day before. I like reflecting on the previous day in the morning. Usually, a night’s rest helps filter out a lot of the noise and I can think about only what’s most important. Occasionally I’ll reflect in the evening too, just depends on the day.\nI grab two books - the Daily Dad and the Daily Stoic. I read the passage for the day from each and jot down my reflection. These ground me and help me focus on what’s most important in my life.\nAfter my daily reflections, I list and prioritize the tasks for the day. Once complete I’m ready to start my work. Morning won!\n\n\nLunch/Workout\nThis is the critical one for me. All the other time blocks are important but this one is thee block. It’s the first thing I put on any shared or digital calendar. I get a notification when it’s about time to get going. I wrap up whatever I’m doing and get outside. To make it easier to get going I often will get ready for a workout or a run beforehand. My shoes, hat, water and other gear are all prepped so there is nothing else to do but get it on and go.\n\n\nWrap-Up Time/Logoff\nTypically, this is the last thirty minutes of the work day. I wrap up the day with notes which I keep in an electronic format. They are very specific to what I’m working on and most easily referenced that way. The tool doesn’t matter but currently, my go-to is OneNote. I reflect on questions like:\n\nHow did the day go?\nWhat Happened? (What did I do today?)\n\nWhat’s Left to do?\nWhat do I need to follow up on?\n\nIt’s not super formal but I try to keep it organized by day or topic and include important technical notes and questions to follow up on etc.\n\n\nStudy Time (Power Hour)\nA few nights a week, after the kids are in bed, I work on a personal project, study up on something new, or write a blog post…I’m in this time block right now!\n\n\n\n\n\nI plan the time and decide the purpose for this time block in the morning. On average I get about an hour for this block if and when it happens. So I need to get going. If I want to maximize the time the last thing I want to do is try to figure out what I want or need to do with this time. That’s a surefire way to waste it.\n\n\nOther Focused Time Blocks\nIf there are tasks that require some intense focus I create similar Power Hours during the day to get the uninterrupted time I need. I’m not shy about reflecting it in my instant messenger status either. I put up a “Do Not Disturb” ⛔ or “Focus” with 🎧, and I’ll typically turn off notifications and close my email app. Most coworkers and teammates respect it, and don’t expect an immediate response. I’m mindful that I’m part of a team and larger organization, so I do resurface at the end of the block to respond to emails and messages I miss."

I hope some of the tactics I’ve implemented inspire you to examine where you’re spending time and use it intentionally.\nStart small and experiment. Focus on one thing you want to do. Does it fit into your life? If so, build up the habit of doing whatever it is little by little on a regular sustainable schedule. I saw a post the other day where someone was talking about building a habit of reading by reading 5 minutes a day. She found the time for 5 minutes and did it. She even gamified it and tries to keep the streak going.\nIf your thing doesn’t fit into your life? Ask yourself why? What’s something you can let go? Odds are there is something you’re going to have to say “no” to, to fit this new thing in. This goes back to step one in defending your time. Here are the steps again:\n\nPrioritize what you’re doing daily. Physically write it down and order it.\nPut it in front of your face, on your calendar, anywhere you’ll see it to remind you to do it.\nYou’ve already thought about it now go do it.\n\nYou can do it I believe in you. ❤"

I enjoyed listening to and appreciating the nature around me. The birds chirping, the sounds of the wind blowing through the trees, and the sound of my footsteps were my new soundtrack. This also allowed me to chat with a few fellow runners as we passed each other. One of the runners told me he only runs five minutes at a time and then walks two minutes. He does it to prevent injury and I could see how this strategy could help. This guy also finished ahead of me so maybe there is something to it."

I rolled my left ankle twice before the halfway point and I was lucky I got away with it. Just a couple of missteps but luckily no pain. As my body fatigued I knew I had to pay more attention to my foot placement and keep my mind focused. In total, I rolled my left ankle five times. I thought the fourth ended my race. I was pissed off and had to stop for a minute to stretch a bit and walk it off. It hurt like hell but I wasn’t done, it wasn’t broken so I tried jogging and didn’t feel too bad. Each time I rolled an ankle my mind had drifted to a thought not on the race. Either I spaced out about what I was going to do later that day, but the really bad ankle roll - I was thinking of an email I had to follow up on at work. WHY?."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Starting from the Beginning\nMy grandfather was a life long learner, he didn’t own a computer until later in life and when we got one he dove deep into understanding how it worked. You could say he started from the beginning. He often would call me with or email me with questions that were far beyond my understanding at the time and now looking back I think he was trying to challenge me to learn more as well as seek understanding for himself.\nMy dad is also a life long learner and recently asked me about learning to write programs. I gave him a book to start learning python. His questions about installation partly inspired this post.\nSo like my grandfather and my dad, I’m starting blogging from the beginning with installing python. I’ve installed python half a dozen times on different machines so here’s some instructions to get python up and running on your machine.\n\n\nInstallation Steps\nThere are a few different ways to get started using Python on Windows. The two I’ve used to install Python:\n\nInstalling Anaconda (which includes Python library and many popular packages, as well as some cool data science tools)\nInstalling Python using a stand-alone installer from Python.org\n\nIn this post, I’ll stick with installing the stand-alone package.\n\nStep 1: Download the package\nFirst, go to https://www.Python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the latest stable version of Python. As of writing that’s version 3.12.0.\n\n\nStep 2: Install\nRun the install package. In the screenshot below notice the include Python in the system path.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it easier to find when setting up your tools later. Starting Python from the command line is also easier. If you change your installation path just note that you should still add it to the system path.\n\n\nStep 3: Test\nMake sure that Python is installed properly. The easiest way is to check the version by typing python -V into the command line of your choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Install Jupyter Notebooks\nLearning a new programming language comes with learning a new ecosystem of tools and libraries. One that is invaluable is Jupyter Notebooks. See below for a brief description of the tool’s main features\nOnce you’ve verified Python is installed. You can use pip to install Jupyter Lab.\npip install jupyterlab\nNotebooks can be used within the browser without any other tool or you can add an extension to Visual Studio Code to run them in VS Code. I alternate between the two but lately have been tending to spend more time in Visual Studio Code.\n\n\nStep 5: Start Jupyterlab and get coding\nGo to the terminal and type in jupyter lab\nAfter it launches open a new notebook and get coding.\n\n\n\nUsing Notebooks\nA notebook is organized as a series of blocks. Each block can either be executable code or just text making it easy to separate executable code from notes about that code in the same file.\nThe notebook can be executed all at once. The order it executes is top-down. OR you can run each block individually. The result of a code block is displayed directly below the block giving you immediate feedback. You can also reference blocks that have been executed before. This gives you the ability to define variables and depend on results from previous code blocks. Here’s an example:\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only do Notebooks ease the learning process but they are used in professional projects so it’s beneficial to learn to use and get comfortable with it. As you get more comfortable with the language and the tool you can make it more interactive."

    "text": "I’ve programmed in python on and off for fun the past few years. Learning the language itself wasn’t difficult. What can be frustrating when learning a new language is the tooling. New languages can involve a different IDE, new libraries, new package managers, etc. it’s like entering a new world OR a new environment 😜.\nWhen I started writing in python, I just wanted to get something running. It wasn’t some huge or serious project, just something fun or quick. A concept I missed initially was virtual environments. Using them would have saved so much frustration. At times there’d be several weeks or months between working on a project. I’d come back update my packages or python itself and instead of trying out my new idea, I ended up creating a problem. The updates broke my app. Instead of moving forward with something, I’d end up fixing the app or my system environment 😦.\n\nWhat are Virtual Environments\nA virtual environment (venv for short) is a collection of package dependencies, binaries and python interpreters which are isolated from the operating system’s python installation and other projects.\nThe virtual environment directory mimics the python base installation and typically created in the project root directory. The folder will either point to the system’s python interpreter or links to it. It also contains packages that you install while it’s activated.\nBefore writing the first line of code for a project, start by setting up the venv. It’ll save you a ton of trouble and will help isolate and manage project dependencies.\nFor a deeper dive on how it works check out the official docs.\n\n\nSetting up an venv\nHere’s basic folder structure for a project. The .venv directory gets created goes in the root of the project. It should not be checked into the your source control system. It’ll need to be created when the repository is cloned. Here’s how to setup your project’s virtual environment for the first time.\nYour project directory might look something like this\nproject-root \\ \n| src \\ \nFirst navigate to your root project\n$ cd project-root\nOnce in your root all you need to do to initialize the environment is:\n$ python -m venv ./venv\nThe argument to venv command is the path of the venv directory. Conventially its named ‘venv’ or ‘.venv’. After executing it, your project directory will look like this:\nproject-root \\ \n| src \\ \n| venv \\\nTo activate the environment (from the root of the project):\n$ ./venv/Scripts/activate\nAt this point packages can be installed without causing conflicts with other projects. As you install dependencies you can extract them and save to a file by running pip freeze:\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\nAdd the requirements.txt file to your code repository. The packages in the virtual environment can simply be installed by running pip install -r requirements .\n\n\nReference\nOfficial Python Docs - venv"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Right around the time of my half-marathon in February, my wife told me that the same trail run organizers - Tejas Trails - announced a race in our local park. It was so close to home that registering for the race was a no-brainer despite the race being on May 25th in Texas. Potentially a hot day! We signed up. I signed up for the 25K(~15.5 miles) bouyed by my recent strong performances.\nMay is hit or miss with heat and humidity. Just three days ago, it was in the mid-80s with mild humidity and a great breeze that made a mid-day run feel great, but that wasn’t the case the Saturday morning of the race. It was sticky and already mid to upper 70s when we left the house. Humidity was high such that when I walked outside from the cool, air-conditioned house, my glasses fogged up. I prepared as best I could. Packed my vest, with two twenty-ounce bottles filled with Tailwind, an electrolyte drink. I had three Gu gels with me for additional nutrition, to be taken every four miles, starting at mile four.\nNerves started as I approached the starting shoot and tried to shake out my legs and muscles as the clock approached 8 AM. The horn blew and we were off. We started running through a field then into the woods we went. The first few miles weren’t bad, but running through the trees was stifling. The air was stale and stagnant. I was telling myself, “hold back, don’t push” and tried to hold a slower pace on the thin single-track trail. Many runners past me but the only thing on my mind was “slow and steady”. The trail wound around and finally came out of the trees onto the wide gravel track through the park. The slight breeze and open air helped cool me down. Thankfully there was still cloud cover as we headed toward the next trail section.\nOn the other end of the park was a major aid station with water, more Tailwind and more goodies to keep us runners going. I assessed my situation. I had about a bottle and a half left, and my 2 packets. I was good and pressed on but made a mental note that I’d probably need to stop on the way back before the next section. As we approached the trail section I almost missed it. I run the path from San Gabriel to the Georgetown Dam quite often and never noticed a trail just to the right leading into the woods. Right back into the woods we went, no more breeze but cooling problems to worry about. The issue with humidity is it makes it harder for the sweat to evaporate from your skin which is the human body’s cooling mechanism. No evaporation, no cooling, possible overheating, leading to exhaustion and worst of all heat stroke. The lack of breeze made it much worse. I trudged on in my new scenic albeit demanding trail. Along the way, I chatted with a few runners which helped me make it through this 2nd section back to the major aide station. Around this time I was ~9.5 miles in. I refilled my bottles as planned and began the last grueling section.\nAt this point, the sun was out, beating down on the trail. We ran first near Blue Hole and then to the Pickett Trail trailhead. The trail ran right along the San Gabriel River and was beautiful. The steep ascents and descents were taxing. On any other day, it would have been a great hike through the woods, but it wasn’t a normal day. It was a HOT race day and I was already struggling. Right around the ten or eleven-mile mark, the heat began to take its toll. I couldn’t cool off. I opened my vest and slowed the pace to a walk feeling dizzy and overheated. This was the pivotal point in my race.\nI crested the hill, light-headed and a little shaky but I made it. My vision narrowed as a little tunnel vision started. I stopped and assessed my situation. Panic wasn’t going to help but could feel it creeping up. I opened my vest again and tried to get more air. There were some steep rocks to climb down, to some stairs before the trail leveled back out. This was not going to be fun and took every bit of focus to get down. Did I mention the race was called River’s Edge? The climb down was at the cliff’s edge.\nMy mind started playing games and slight panic was trying to make its way to the forefront of my thoughts. I persevered and carefully navigated down to level ground. It took intense focus to step carefully down and simultaneously block out thoughts of what I misstep would mean. Once down I walked and maintained forward movement, there was no other option. At this point, I tossed out any expectations I had of running the rest of the race. The goal was to finish standing, and enjoy a lazy Saturday afternoon recovering at home, not in the medic tent or hospital. So I kept on walking. I made it back to the aid station where I refueled before and re-filled everything before the last three-quarter mile back to the finish. “I don’t care how close I am to the finish,” I thought. “There was no way I was going to skip the aid station. I was getting both bottles topped off.”\nMy wife and her friends cheered me on as I shuffled past, soaked and exhausted. I mustered a jog for the finish and crossed the finish line with a mixture of pride and relief."

    "text": "But wait where are the lessons\n\nLesson 1: Listen to your body\nYears of running, especially under the scorching Texas sun, have taught me the importance of listening to my body. According to my Garmin, the temperature peaked at 96.8°F. This wasn’t a day to push myself more than necessary. I took breaks, walked and stopped occasionally to cool down. There is no point in doing this if it ends up hurting me.\n\n\nLesson 2: Discipline can mean many things.\nIn the past, I would have beaten myself up for walking or even thinking about it. Now, as a seasoned runner and parent, my mindset has changed. Race day doesn’t mean a day off from being a parent. In this case, discipline means that I have enough energy to take care of my kids and show up for them when I’m back home.\nDiscipline also meant recognizing danger signs my body was signaling and responding accordingly. Could I have prepared better? Maybe, but training doesn’t always go perfectly either. I want to be running as long as I possibly can. I want to do races with my kids and possibly their kids if I’m lucky. I was disciplined in listening to my body and focusing on my goal of longevity. Had I been short-sighted and stubbornly focused on my performance in this race alone, it could have been a disaster of a weekend and negatively impacted my health in all sorts of ways.\n\n\nLesson 3: Power of Resilience\nTwo weekends before the race, I was blindsided by a virus. Despite a consistent running routine, I found myself more exhausted than usual post-run. I didn’t think much of it just a cold probably and took a few days off. Then it seemed to come back with a rash, a super weird dizzy spell and vertigo. At this point I got it checked out. I tested negative for everything. Not flu, Not COVID, Not strep. It scared me and recovery was rough. After a few days in bed, with the race looming I was convinced I was going to drop out. I felt my training was shot. As my strength returned I tried some weight-lifting. That seemed to go well and I felt strong. The weekend before the race I continued experimenting with a long run. I finished an eight-mile run and felt great. I was back and determined. I set my expectations accordingly - this wasn’t going to be a walk in the park, but I aimed to get out there and finish."
