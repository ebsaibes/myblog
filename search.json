My career started in semiconductor manufacturing where I developed and maintained manufacturing automation systems. Eventually I found my way into software consulting.\nI’ve worked on several .NET projects in a variety of industries and varying solution type. Some projects highlights include building and improving web applications, developing identity solutions, event-based systems, modernizing systems, and data engineering.\nAway from my keyboard, you’ll usually find me running, hanging out with my family, fixing things around the house, and building things."

You can expect to see articles about topics in Machine Learning, .NET, C#, python and other technical topics.\nI’m not limiting the posts strictly technical topics. I have many other roles in my life besides being a software engineer and consultant. I’m a father of three, I’m a husband, I run, I build things, I fix things, I break things, I like cars the list goes on. You might see these things sprinkled in."
